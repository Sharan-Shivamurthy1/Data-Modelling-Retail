# Data-Modelling-Retail
The repository provides a deeper insight into retail data modelling, data pipelining and data mart creation.

Requirement:

The company’s marketing department requests a segmentation of the users to create
dedicated marketing campaigns for these segments. To determine the segments the
Data Science Team wants to cluster the users and needs appropriate features to create
the model.

Tasks:
● Design a data pipeline, which provides a data mart with the next features for
each customer:
- age
- country
- state
- nearest distribution center
- product return rate in the last year
- customer profit level in the last year
Level 1 if the customer has bought products for 50$ or less,
Level 2 - more than 50 but less than 150$,
Level 3 - more than 150$.
What additional features would you recommend? Why?
